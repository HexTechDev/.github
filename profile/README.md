## Projects

* [Rolling Rhino Remix](https://rollingrhino.org) - Rolling Rhino Remix is an unofficial Ubuntu flavour which converts the Ubuntu operating system into a rolling release Linux distribution by tracking the devel series. A rolling release distribution is a Linux distribution which receives continuous package updates, and as such there are no major updates (unlike Ubuntuâ€™s current release model where there is clear progression between versions). A rolling release model offers new and experienced users a new way to utilise their desktop PC, without the hassle of major upgrades.
* [SCAchat](https://github.com/hextechdev/scachat) - SCAchat is a self-hosted chatting application similar to AOL Instant Messenger. The chatting application is privacy-respecting and does not store any messages or user-data. Once a session has ended, all messages are gone.
* [SkyWM](https://github.com/hextechdev/skywm) - skyWM is a minimalistic window manager written in Rust. skyWM takes inspiration from the Unix philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well. skyWM has now become a part of the CatiumDE utilities and is maintained under one organisation.
